# Probability Simulation & Statistical Concepts

## 📌 Objective

This project demonstrates fundamental probability and statistical concepts using Python simulations.

The goal is to build strong intuition around:

- Probability estimation
- Law of Large Numbers
- Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 1️⃣ Coin Toss Simulation
Simulated 1000 coin tosses using random sampling to estimate the probability of heads.

Expected probability:
P(Heads) = 0.5

---

### 2️⃣ Law of Large Numbers

As the number of trials increases, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical probability (0.5).

The running average stabilizes over time, demonstrating convergence.

---

### 3️⃣ Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

Repeated sampling (sample size = 30) was performed 1000 times.

Observation:
The distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution.
